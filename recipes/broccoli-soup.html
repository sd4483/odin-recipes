                    <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
                    <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Place broccoli, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
                    <li>Roast vegetables until soft, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Chop 1/4 cup of broccoli florets; set aside for garnish.</li>
                    <li>Combine remaining vegetables with vegetable broth, cream cheese, and lemon pepper in a high-powered blender or food processor in batches. Puree soup until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour soup into a saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with additional lemon pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls. Garnish with reserved chopped broccoli and crushed red pepper.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
                    <p>
                        A 1 1/2 pound head of broccoli yields about 5 cups of chopped florets and stems.
                        Chop broccoli stalks no thicker than 1/4-inch to ensure the pieces cook in the allotted time.
