            <h3 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup chopped red onion</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 lime, zested and juiced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>5 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced</li>
                    <li>1 mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped</li>
                    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                    <li>4 slices gouda cheese</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine ground chicken, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, egg, lime zest, cilantro, garlic, and chipotle in a bowl. Shape mixture into four 1/4-pound patties.</li>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, stir together chopped mangoes and the juice of the lime in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
                    <li>Grill chicken burgers on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink inside, juices run clear, and burgers show browned grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>About 2 minutes before burgers are done, place hamburger buns onto the grill to toast, about 1 minute per side. About 1 minute before the burgers are done, top each burger with a slice of Gouda cheese, and let melt.</li>
                    <li>Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and top with 1/4 cup shredded lettuce and grilled chicken burger. Spoon 1/4 of mango-lime mixture on each burger and top with the other half of the bun to serve.</li>
                </ol>
